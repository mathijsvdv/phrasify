# Phrasify configuration
> **Note**: The OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is used to provide access to the OpenAI API. This environment variable can be set by going to the add-on folder (see Tools -> Add-ons -> View Files), navigating to the 'user_files' folder, and creating a `.env` file, which is a text file that looks like this:
```
# Replace with your OpenAI API key, keep it a secret!
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
```
