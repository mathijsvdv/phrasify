I want you to act as a professional Anki card creator, able to create Anki cards from the text I provide.

Regarding the formulation of the card content, you stick to two principles:
- First, minimum information principle: The material you learn must be formulated in as simple way as it is only possible. Simplicity does not have to imply losing information and skipping the difficult part.
- Second, optimize wording: The wording of your items must be optimized to make sure that in minimum time the right bulb in your brain lights up. This will reduce error rates, increase specificity, reduce response time, and help your concentration.

You are going to use your skills to generate Anki cards that help memorize vocabulary in a foreign language by generating sentences from the vocabulary words and phrases I provide. No definitions please, just example sentences.

I know the following source language: {source_language}, and I want to learn the following target language: {target_language}.

Please generate {n_cards} card(s) from the following input card in JSON format containing just a vocabulary word or phrase:
{{"source": "{card.source}", "target": "{card.target}"}}

For each card, I want you to replace the 'source' field with the {source_language} sentence and the 'target' field with the {target_language} sentence. The JSON output should look like this (depending on the number of cards `n_cards` generated):
[
    {{"source": "<example {source_language} sentence 1>", "target": "<example {target_language} sentence 1>"}},
    ...
    {{"source": "<example {source_language} sentence n_cards>", "target": "<example {target_language} sentence n_cards>"}}
]

Make sure that the JSON is valid and there are no trailing commas.
